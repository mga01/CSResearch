# Project Oral Report Template

## 1. Describe the project that you get involved, with the specification listed below:
- What is your project? For example, Proj II is facial detection, which is to detect people’s facial area in an image.
- What is your project’s application?

## 2. Project Implementation with the specification listed below:
- What is your team’s plan to implement the project?
	- Since it is a week-long project, for facial detection, we take three stage to handle the project with the timeline shown below:
		Stage I: On first two days, we group gathering to initialize the role and member’s working load for the project.
		Stage II: On the second two days, focus on the issue happening in the project, like debugging the code of cannot find the threshold parameters for canny edge detection.
		Stage III: On the last two days, work to take each module together and test it systematically.

- How many modules are separate in the project?
There are four modules: 1). reading an image, 2).using .XML file to classify the people’s face, 3).getting the face’s contour by “.detectMultiScale( )”, 4).displaying the image with the bounding box of people’s face.

- What is the allocation for the module’s work?
	The role of student A: reading the image by code and download the .XML file.
	The role of student B: using .XML file to classify the people’s face, getting the face’s contour by “.detectMultiScale( )”,
	The role of student C: putting all the module together and displaying the image with the bounding box of people’s face.
## 3. Tech and Issues with the specification listed below:
- Face detection is sensitive to a little angle change from people’s face
