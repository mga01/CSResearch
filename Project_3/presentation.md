# Project Three: Facial Recognition

## 1. Describe the project that you get involved, with the specification listed below:
- Project three is facial recognition, which detects, recognizes, and labels a learned face either with the target's appropriate name or unkown.
- Use cases:
 	- Counterterrorism
 	- Airport security

## 2. Project Implementation:
- Stage I: Initialize the project's base code.
- Stage II: Adjusted the code to to be functional.
- Stage III: Revise the code.

- Five fundamental modules:
	1. Reading the image files of target faces
	2. Encode target faces
	3. Read and encoded the new image file
	4. Determine if face is known
	5. Appropriately label face.

## 3. Tech and Issues:
- Libraries used:
	- cv2
	- face_recognition
